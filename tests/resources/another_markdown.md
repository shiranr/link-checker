If you are using FxCop analyzers and StyleCop analyzer, it's very simple to enable those in the CI. You have to make sure you are setting up the project using nuget and .editorconfig ([see Project setup](#project-setup)). Once you have this setup, you will have to configure the pipeline to build your code. That's pretty much it. The FxCop analyzers will run and report the result in your build pipeline. If there are rules that are violated, your build will be red.

"*Load testing is performed to determine a system's behavior under both normal and anticipated peak load conditions.*" - [Load testing - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_testing)

A load test is designed to determine how a system behaves under expected normal and peak workloads.  Specifically its main purpose is to confirm if a system can handle the expected load level. Depending on the target system this could be concurrent users, requests per second or data size.

## Why Load Testing

The main objective is to prove the system can behave normally under the expected normal load before releasing it to production. The criteria which defines "behave normally" will depend on your target, this may be as simple as "the system remains available", but it could also include meeting a response time SLA or error rate.

Additionally, the results of a load test can also be used as data to help with capacity planning and calculating scalability.
